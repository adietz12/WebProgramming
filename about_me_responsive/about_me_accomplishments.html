          <p>My biggest accomplishments come from my work as a diplomat and advisor to president Nixon. I developed a policy of detente with the Soviet Union which lead to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks agreement. I also initiated the first U.S. contact with China and engaged in shuttle democracy with the Middle East. I was also a huge advocate for the Vietnam war, so much so that I was able to initiate a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia during it. Some people might call me a "war criminal" for it, but it helped the U.S. reach a stalemate with Vietnam.</p>
